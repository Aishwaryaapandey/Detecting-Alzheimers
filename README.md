# Detecting-Alzheimers
The project uses ML models (PCA, LDA, SVM, VGG16, EfficientNetB0) to detect and classify Alzheimer's. Detection models identify Alzheimer's in brain images, while classification models assess severity (non, very mild, mild, moderate). This helps in early diagnosis and treatment, improving life expectancy and quality.
